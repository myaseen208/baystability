## Overview

**baystability** fits the linear-bilinear models of multi-environment
trials, AMMI and SREG (GGE), by the general Bayesian method of
Perez-Elizalde, Jarquin and Crossa (2012). The data of an earlier trial
with the same genotypes and environments can be the prior: its cell
means, effects and singular value decomposition give conjugate normal
and von Mises-Fisher priors, weighted by its replicates. Every parameter
has a posterior distribution, and the biplot carries highest posterior
density (HPD) regions.

- [`bayes_ammi()`](https://myaseen208.com/baystability/reference/bayes_ammi.md):
  the Gibbs sampler (compiled), with `.prior_data` (an earlier trial as
  prior), `.model = "AMMI"` or `"SREG"`, the number of terms, chains,
  burn-in and a seed; summaries with HPD intervals, diagnostics, DIC and
  WAIC;
- [`bayes_gge()`](https://myaseen208.com/baystability/reference/bayes_gge.md):
  the SREG (GGE) model, the same as `bayes_ammi(.model = "SREG")`;
- [`bayes_ammi_biplot()`](https://myaseen208.com/baystability/reference/bayes_ammi_biplot.md),
  [`bayes_gge_biplot()`](https://myaseen208.com/baystability/reference/bayes_ammi_biplot.md):
  the biplots with HPD regions;
- [`bys_compare()`](https://myaseen208.com/baystability/reference/bys_compare.md):
  WAIC and DIC of several fits;
  [`bys_interpret()`](https://myaseen208.com/baystability/reference/bys_interpret.md):
  a plain-language interpretation;
  [`bys_cite()`](https://myaseen208.com/baystability/reference/bys_cite.md):
  the references of a result;
- [`bys_ls_means()`](https://myaseen208.com/baystability/reference/bys_ls_means.md),
  [`bys_ls_ge_effects()`](https://myaseen208.com/baystability/reference/bys_ls_ge_effects.md),
  [`bys_ls_ammi()`](https://myaseen208.com/baystability/reference/bys_ls_ammi.md)
  and the other `bys_ls_` functions: the tables and the least-squares
  AMMI (the names of version 0.2.0 still work, with a deprecation
  warning);
- [`bys_app()`](https://myaseen208.com/baystability/reference/bys_app.md):
  all of this in a web browser, without code.

Version 1.0.0 replaces the sampler of version 0.2.0. That version read
the earlier trial from objects in the workspace, never sampled the
singular values and returned a precision computed from a residual that
was never updated (see NEWS). The new sampler reproduces the 38 linear
effects of Table B.1 of the paper to within 0.03 posterior standard
deviations. It adds exact two-column moves, without which the genotype
scores of a fit with all terms cannot move.

For Bayesian stability analysis in general (Finlay-Wilkinson,
Eberhart-Russell and Shukla models, stability indices, probabilities of
superior performance), see **bayesstability**. For the Bayesian AMMI
model of Crossa et al. (2011), see **bayesammi**.
